Code deficiencies and bugs constitute an unavoidable part of software systems.
%
In safety-critical systems, like aircrafts or medical equipment, 
even a single bug can lead to catastrophic impacts
such as injuries or death.
%
Formal verification can be used to statically 
track code deficiencies by proving or disproving correctness properties 
of a system. 
%
However, at its current state formal verification is a cumbersome process
that is rarely used by mainstream developers. 

Theorem provers can be used for verification, 
but they are limited to  verification specific non general purpose 
languages (Coq, Adga, Dafny).
%
Our goal is to allow verification in general purpose languages, like Haskell.

In this work we present how Haskell is turn into a theorem prover
via the abstraction framework of Liquid Types
that moreover use SMT-based automatic verification. 
%
We implemented out technique in Liquid Haskell 
a refinement type verifier for Haskell code 
and use both to verify shallow invariants of existing Haskell code 
and to check deep properties of sophisticated program invariants.
