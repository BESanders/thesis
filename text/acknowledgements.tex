I want to thank Ranjit Jhala for being such a great advisor. 
%
It is his unique way to interpret, simplify, and beautify all my 
thoughts
and his strong willingness to do useful research 
that directed all my work. 

A big thanks to my committee members 
Samuel R. Buss, 
Cormac Flanagan,
Sorin Lerner, 
and Daniele Micciancio for their interest and insights in my work. 

Next, I thank all the students of the UCSD programming languages group and specifically my coauthors
Patric Rondon,
Alexander Bakst, 
Eric Seidel 
for providing a supportive, friendly, and and inspiring working environment.

I want to thank all these people who hosted me in my internships. 
%
%The Opa group in Paris who foresaw that types can help industrial development.
%
Then, Dimitrios Vytiniotis and Simon Peyton-Jones
at Microsoft Research Cambridge
who were the first ghc people who believed in Liquid Haskell
and have been still supporting both the project and me personally.
%
I want to thank Jeff Polakow and all the people at Awake Networks 
for giving me the opportunity to spend an awesome summer in Mountain View 
and use Liquid Haskell in real world development code. 
%
Last but not least, 
I want to thank Daan Leijen 
for hosting me at Microsoft Research Redmond 
and mentoring me since then, giving me all his insightful
knowledge and  about research and life in general.

Finally, I want to thanks all the family and friends, around the world,
who supported me throughout this journey.
%
All the people from San Diego, 
who made me feel San Diego as home, with all the goods and bads. 
%
All the friends I met in the infinite travelling in these five years, 
that made me realize how knowledge unites people from different parts of the globe.
%
All my friends and family in Greece that never let me forget that
whenever I want I have a paradise waiting for me.  
%
Specifically, my parents Voula and Nikos and my sister Marianna
who staid up all these Sunday nights for our online calls. 

It is great that the destination is reached, 
but after all, it is the journey that matters.
