\begin{abstract}
SMT-based checking of refinement types for call-by-value languages 
is a well-studied subject. Unfortunately, the classical translation of refinement 
types to verification conditions is unsound under lazy evaluation.
When checking an expression, such systems implicitly assume that all 
the free variables in the expression are bound 
to \emph{values}.
%
This property is trivially guaranteed by eager,   
but does not hold under lazy, evaluation. 
Thus, to be sound and precise, a refinement 
type system for Haskell and the corresponding verification conditions 
must take into account \emph{which subset of} binders actually 
reduces to values. 
%
We present a stratified type system that labels 
binders as potentially diverging or not, and that 
(circularly) uses refinement types to verify the 
labeling.
%
We have implemented our system in \toolname and 
present an experimental evaluation of our approach
on more than 10,000 lines of widely used Haskell 
libraries.
%
We show that \toolname is able to prove 96\% of 
all recursive functions terminating, while requiring a modest 
1.7 lines of termination-annotations per 100 lines of code.
