\section{Memory Safety}\label{sec:memory-safety}

The terms ``Haskell'' and ``pointer arithmetic'' rarely occur in the same
sentence, yet many Haskell programs are constantly manipulating pointers under
the hood by way of using the \bytestring and \libtext libraries. These libraries
sacrifice safety for (much needed) speed and are therefore natural candidates for
verification through \toolname.
